" An example for a vimrc file.

" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>
" Last change:	2008 Dec 17

" To use it, copy it to
"     for Unix and OS/2:  ~/.vimrc
"        Amiga:  s:.vimrc
"  for MS-DOS and Win32:  $VIM\_vimrc
"       for OpenVMS:  sys$login:.vimrc


"so I recently (Sat 29 Aug 2015) changed the way my Vim works
"previously I had a Vim folder in Dropbox and that contained 
"the my vimrc.vim and the plugins I installed. 
"Now I've decided to use Vundle to manage my plugins, and also
"I'm switching from Dropbox to Github for my vimrc.vim
"The idea is I clone https://github.com/sykstan/dotfiles.git
"in my $HOME, ln -s the vimrc.vim there to $HOME/.vimrc
"and then it will set up ~/.vim/ the same way across different 
"systems. This will hopefully be much simpler than the MySys()
"function method of determining where I was and adding Dropbox/Vim
"to the runtimepath. Plugins will still be in .vim/bundle/

" pathogen (Thur 27 March 2014)
" using Vundle now (Sat 29 Aug 2015)
"execute pathogen#infect()

" Use Vim settings, rather than Vi settings (much better!).
" This must be first, because it changes other options as a side effect.
